# ü§ñ Support Ticket Agent using RAG and LangGraph

This project implements an intelligent **AI-powered Support Ticket Agent** leveraging **LangGraph** for workflow orchestration and **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** for contextual responses.  
The agent resolves routine inquiries, retries bad drafts automatically, and escalates tough cases with full context.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Architectural Decisions  

The agent is built on **LangGraph‚Äôs `StateGraph`**, with a clear modular design. Every piece has a single responsibility, making the system easy to extend and debug.  

1. **LangGraph Orchestration (`src/main.py`)**  
   - The function `support_agent()` defines and compiles the whole workflow.  
   - Handles multi-step execution with conditional routing and retry loops.  
   - Easy to visualize and debug in **LangGraph Studio**.  

2. **Atomic Nodes (`src/nodes/*.py`)**  
   - Each operation is its own node: `classify`, `retrieve`, `draft`, `review`, `retry`, `escalate`.  
   - This modular approach makes testing and maintenance simple.  

3. **Centralized State (`src/state.py`)**  
   - A shared `AgentState` (`TypedDict`) keeps ticket info, category, context, drafts, attempts, etc.  
   - Ensures data flows consistently between nodes.  

4. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**  
   - Implemented in `src/simple_rag.py`.  
   - Loads docs from `data/mock_docs.json` and injects relevant info into the draft.  
   - Prevents hallucinations by grounding answers in knowledge base.  

5. **Self-Correction Loop**  
   - Draft ‚Üí Review ‚Üí Retry flow ensures bad drafts don‚Äôt reach the user.  
   - `review` node gives feedback, `retry` node updates state, and draft regenerates.  
   - Mimics a real QA process.  

6. **Escalation (`src/nodes/escalate.py`)**  
   - If retries fail, ticket is logged into `escalations.csv`.  
   - Ensures unresolved issues are handed off cleanly to human agents.
